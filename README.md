# Automated Plant Watering System 
 This is the project we chose for the Engineering design project module in semester 2. (In20-S2-EN1190 - Engineering Design Project)
 
# our project 

## Abstract:
The Automated Plant Watering System is designed to be used in home gardening to water plants when the moisture level in the soil drops below a certain level. Our main objective for this project is to provide a perfect solution for the problem that we identified, and the product that we develop should be cost-effective, easily repairable, and durable. In order to realize the design, we used software such as CircuitLab, Altium, and SolidWorks. The circuit simulation is checked using the CircuitLab simulator. The PCB design is done using the Altium software, and the enclosure is designed using SolidWorks software.

## Introduction:
The Automated Plant Watering System is an innovative solution designed to provide efficient and reliable watering for plants. The system is a response to the economic crisis in Sri Lanka and the need to encourage people to cultivate their own food. Many people are unable to tend to their plants due to busy schedules, leading to plant death. The Automated Plant Watering System is an easy-to-use system that automates the process of watering plants, ensuring their growth and health.

## Functionality:
The Automated Plant Watering System is a complete analog electronic system that detects soil moisture and the amount of water in the tank. It is designed to operate based on soil moisture readings and water availability in the tank. The system has a sensor that detects the moisture in the soil and signals the motor to distribute water to the soil if it is dry. The motor is connected using a relay module, which controls the water flow to the plants. The system also has a water level sensor that detects the amount of water in the tank. If the water level in the tank is low, an alarm is triggered to alert the user. The alarm is manually turned off by the user when the water is refilled. The system also has a timer that the user can adjust to control the water flow to the plants.

## User Interface:
The Automated Plant Watering System has an easy-to-use user interface that consists of two buttons and two knobs. The first button turns on the system, and the second button turns on/off the alarm. The first knob is used to control the timer, and the second knob is used to adjust the soil sensitivity. The soil sensitivity knob adjusts the dryness of the soil that should be present before the system starts watering the plants. The system is user-friendly and requires minimal effort from the user.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Automated Plant Watering System is an efficient and innovative solution to the economic crisis in Sri Lanka. It is an easy-to-use system that automates the process of watering plants and ensures their growth and health. The system is designed to operate based on soil moisture readings and water availability in the tank. The user interface is simple and requires minimal effort from the user. The Automated Plant Watering System is a cost-effective solution that promotes sustainable living and encourages people to cultivate their own food.
